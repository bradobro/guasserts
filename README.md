# Is

The `Gu` library stives to remain very slim. If all you need is basic logical assertions, `Gu` has you covered.

If, on the other hand, you need richer assertions, `Is` gives you that. None of the ideas are new; only the packaging.

Is capitalizes on the excellent assertion pattern introduced by GoConvey.
